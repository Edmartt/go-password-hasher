# Password Hasher

## This project is intended to ease the use of bcrypt package abstracting the developer from using arrays of bytes and all necessary stuff for hashing a string and making it as simple as just to call the need function and passing a string as argument

### What you can do:
- convert a plaintext string to hash 
- checks if a plaintext string is equal to a hash
